Micro-optimized version of [pretty fast Actionscript3 AStar](https://github.com/tomnewton/AS3AStar) written by [Tom Newton](http://yyztom.com/).

Demo of original version can be found on [his webpage](http://yyztom.com/post/4134224616/pretty-fast-astar-in-actionscript-3).

What you're seeing here is a sample of code i made for someone quite a while ago, and i seriously doubt it will be improved by me in the future. You might be interested in looking on another [fork](https://github.com/martin-mfg/AS3-AStar), which might contain some interesting improvements and/or bugfixes.
